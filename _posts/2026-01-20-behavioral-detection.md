## Goal
Leverage Artificial Intelligence and advanced monitoring to enhance threat detection and system hardening.

## Description
This project focuses on developing a **real-time anomaly detection system** to distinguish between normal behaviors and simulated attacks.

### Key Features
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted 15+ characteristics using sliding window techniques.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Implemented complete pipeline using **Isolation Forest**, **One-Class SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
- **Orchestration**: Deployed using **Docker Compose**.
- **Interface**: Interactive UI built with **Streamlit** and a CLI for management.

### Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Docker
- Streamlit
